The bells ring again, like they&#39;re calling my name. The sound comes down from the baroque lips of the Dom Tower. It gets into the canals and resurrects through the streets. 

Everything is empty. The snow keeps falling. Then this black cat meows, passes trackless through the snow and out of sight around the corner. 

The lonely tower ceases ringing.
